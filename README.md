# KrampusUI
External UI for the exploit krampus

## Features
- Easy Integration
- Auto Inject
- Close Roblox
- Correct **wss://loader.live** authentication (you won't get ratelimited)

## How does it work?
Once you've selected your krampus root directory it'll look for your **launch.cfg** file, grab your authentication key and replicate connections to **wss://loader.live**

## Pre-builds
[Beta](https://github.com/NotDSF/KrampusUI/releases/tag/beta)

## App setup 
Upon launching the app you will be greeted with a **loader.live** login screen, you will need to login to continue.        
_(This will grab your login token to use in **wss://loader.live** authentication)_

## Auto Inject
You'll need to set your krampus root directory, you can do this by navigativing to **Configuration** -> **Choose installation path**
_(every time you start the app)_
