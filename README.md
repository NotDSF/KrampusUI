# KrampusUI
External UI for the exploit krampus

## How does it work?
Once you've selected your krampus root directory it'll look for your **launch.cfg** file, grab your authentication key and replicate connections to **wss://loader.live**

## Pre-builds
[Pre-prelease](https://github.com/NotDSF/KrampusUI/releases/tag/prerelease)

## App setup 
You'll need to set your krampus root directory, you can do this by navigativing to **Configuration** -> **Choose installation path**
_(every time you start the app)_
